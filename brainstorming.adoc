= Brainstorming

== Dependency Injection to Domain Functions

Provide a generic `service` function to the domain layer, which is data driven.

Declare interfaces as `def`'s and reference them in the `service` call.

== Misc

=== Stratified Design

==== Layers

===== Domain Entities

Accessors. Predicates. Comparators. Virtual Property Accessors.

Custom Modifiers (like `assoc`) create update infomation for current transaction.

===== Business Rules

===== Commands / Use-Cases

=== Command Query Responsibility Segregation

Use entities Layer as the read model.

Create getters by macros to register metadata with validators, coercers, docs, etc.
